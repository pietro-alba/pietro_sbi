# pietro_sbi

This repository contains two folders:
- pietrosbi: you can find the functions needed to create the data and analyse them with Simulation Based Inference (SBI), which uses Neural Density Estimators.
- Tutorials: you can find tutorials on how to use all these functions.
  
I mainly used the package sbi to implement this inference method.
I applied SBI on two astrophysical parameters of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR): the ionization efficiency and the virial temperature.
