# pietro_sbi

This repository contains the code I wrote during my internship at the École Normale Supérieure, where I applied Simulation Based Inference (SBI) on a period of the universe called Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). 
SBI uses Neural Density Estimators to infer the parameters used to siulate a map of the EoR. 
In this project, I applied it on two astrophysical parameters of the EoR: the ionization efficiency and the virial temperature.
I mainly used the package sbi (https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi) to implement this inference method.

This repository has two folders:
- pietrosbi: you can find the functions used to create the data and analyse them with SBI.
- Tutorials: you can find tutorials on how to use the functions in pietrosbi.
